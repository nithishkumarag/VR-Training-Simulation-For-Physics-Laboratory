#  VR-Training-Simulation-For-Physics-Laboratory
## MCA - Final year Project

&ensp;We implemented a project using Virtual Reality (VR) technology to enhance educational experiences by creating an immersive VR training simulation for physics labs. This project focused on developing an interactive and realistic virtual environment where students could conduct hands-on experiments on Ohm's Law and logic gate operations. Using Blender for 3D modeling and Unity for building the VR experience, we created a safe and controlled space where students could manipulate equipment and observe scientific phenomena. The project demonstrated VRâ€™s potential to supplement traditional lab teaching and improve learning outcomes in physics education.

### Project Overview:
&ensp;The two main ideas of the VR training simulation for the Physics Laboratory are Logic
Gates and Ohm's Law.
### Ohm's Law Experiment: 
&ensp;By manipulating variables like voltage, current, and resistance,
users can engage with virtual electrical circuits and examine the relationship outlined by Ohm's
Law (V = IR). In a secure and regulated virtual setting, hands-on learning and experimentation
are made possible by this interactive simulation.
### Logic Gates Simulation: 
&ensp;Virtual representations of logic gates, including AND, OR, NAND,
NOR, and NOT gates, will also be included in the simulation. By linking these gates in various
combinations to build logical circuits, users can investigate how these gates work. Users are
better able to comprehend the basic ideas of digital logic with this practical method.
### Blender (3D Models):
&ensp;We have designed and produced intricate three-dimensional models of all the necessary
tools for a physics lab experiments, such as a 
1. Resistance box
2. Voltmeter
3. Ammeter
4. Rheostat.
5. Logic gates<br/>
### Project Demonstration Video:
&ensp; The below video demonstrates how the application works in the Meta Quest 2:<br/>
